# RAT-Selection-Algorithms
Radio Access Technology(RAT) selection algorithms fall under a classical concept in Heterogeneous Wireless Network(HWN) design called Joint Radio Resource Management(JRRM)\\
RAT selection is the process of selecting the best available network access in the area where different network access technologies overlap. \\
This can be difficult process because a number of attributes need to be considered in decision making, and more often, a single mobile station would want to support different class of calls (services simulteneously).\\
The techniques that often used for decisions making when there are multiple criteria to consider are collectively called \bf Multiple Attribute Decision Making(MADM) techniques.\\
