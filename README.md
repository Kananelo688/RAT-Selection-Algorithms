# RAT-Selection-Algorithms
Radio Access Technology(RAT) selection algorithms fall under a classical concept in Heterogeneous Wireless Network(HWN) design called Joint Radio Resource Management(JRRM).<br>
RAT selection is the process of selecting the best available network access in the area where different network access technologies overlap. <br>
This can be difficult process because a number of attributes need to be considered in decision making, and more often, a single mobile station would want to support different class of calls (services simulteneously).<br>
The techniques that often used for decisions making when there are multiple criteria to consider are collectively called <strong> Multiple Attribute Decision Making(MADM) </strong> techniques.<br>
A number of these techniques have been proposed in pressure and used in different disciplines such su politics, humanities, and so on. The purpose of this  project to to design a system that simulates RAT selection process in a wireless Heterogeneous Network, that support a single-class of calls. MADM techniques considered are: <br>
- SAW : Simple Additive Weighting
- TOPSIS : Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution
- MEW  : Multiplicatibe Exponential Weighting
- GRA : Gray Relational Analysis
